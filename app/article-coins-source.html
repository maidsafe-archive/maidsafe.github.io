    <p><strong>Coins Source</strong><br>22 April 2014</p>
    <p>MaidSafe (Massive Array of Internet Disks) opened a <a href="http://www.safecoin.io/" target="_blank">crowd-funding sale</a> for their new generation &lsquo;currency&rsquo; called <a href="http://www.safecoin.io/" target="_blank">Safecoins</a>.  The currency serves as a gateway into their &rsquo;7 year project&rsquo;, a  peer-to-peer decentralized platform for the internet. Data on this  platform becomes heavily encrypted or &lsquo;shredded&rsquo;, then distributed  through vast computer servers around the world. All data is ultimately  secure, private, decentralized and protected from deletion or removal:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The SAFE network takes all the Internet services  currently available today and decentralizes them, removing servers and  other central points of weakness enabling privacy, security and  anonymity to all Internet users for the first time.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The 100% open sourced project incorporates and builds upon Bitcoin&rsquo;s  accomplishments to create a system whichÂ will prevent prying eyes, identity theft and fraudulent activities.</p>
