    <p>Maidsafe was originally conceptualized in 2002 by David Irvine. Irvine realized that implementing and administering small business servers was problematic and complex. In the search for a solution he deduced that rather than trying to make these servers easier to use, he could remove them altogether.</p>
    <p>Irvine envisioned a fully distributed data service, which manages data and communications. This is different to the current internet where “Whole files readable by anyone are stored on centralized servers”.</p>
    <p>Irvine incorporated MaidSafe.net LTD in February 2006, after four years of mulling over the issues. His first point of call was to spend time in a non-English speaking country to work uninterrupted. He spent 6 months in the Czech Republic, forming the overarching network, and thus: 'Massive Array of Internet Disks with Secure Access For Everyone', MAIDSAFE, was born.</p>
    <p>MaidSafe addresses privacy by implementing three distinct security stages. The first is an algorithm implementing encryption by using the data within each file to produce keying material. In order for the user to access their data this keying material is used. This encryption is applied by the client, prior to data chunking and dispersal.</p>
    <p>The second stage is implemented by the MaidSafe protocol. The already encrypted files are chunked and then further secured with the Encrypt Library. This is not an encryption algorithm per se, rather this is an algorithm that utilises existing algorithms (predominantly AES 256).</p>
