      <h1>Job Opportunities at MaidSafe</h1>
      <p>We are looking for talented open source developers to join the MaidSafe team.<a href="mailto:careers@maidsafe.net"></a>
      </p>


      <h2>How to Apply</h2>
      <p>Applications should be sent to : <a href="mailto:careers@maidsafe.net">careers@maidsafe.net</a>. Please supply us with a list of URLs of evidence showing us why you would be a great hire for us, explaining to us context of those URLs where necessary and we will get back to you if we would like any additional information.</p>
      <p>All applications will be reviewed.</p>

      <h2>MaidSafe Hiring Process</h2>
      <p>To give you a feel for how we work, here is our guide for applicants who are invited for interview:</p>
      <h3>Prepare for your MaidSafe interview</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Know what interests you about maidsafe and why you've applied.</li>
        <li>Familiarise yourself with our products(you may be asked business-related questions). Research our competitors.</li>
        <li>If you are interviewing for a software engineering or technical role, be ready to answer high-level technical questions on data-structures and algorithms. We would like you to code up your answers on boards with our people.</li>
        <li>Familiarise yourself with the job description you are interested in.</li>
        <li>If you are interviewing for a software engineering role and are experienced in c++ or java then you may first want to visit <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">this</a> website. You may find the questions
          there very similar to what you may be asked to describe [spoilers]</li>
        <li>If you are interviewing for a software engineering role become familiar with, c++ or python, kademlia DHT and networking technologies such as NAT traversal, ice, upnp, stun, turn, udp and tcp communications. Failure to do this will waste everyone's
          time and could be embarrassing (although we try hard not to).</li>
        <li>Ensure you can substantiate anything your CV says - for instance, if you list Java, c++ or ice skating, questions about this are fair game and are very likely to be asked of you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>At the Interview</h3>
      <p>First of all congratulations, you have something in your CV that we find interesting and special.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not wear suits to work and neither should you to an interview, smart but casual is more comfortable.</li>
        <li>Probably you will be there 1 hour or 2 hours with a break.</li>
        <li>You will be asked to draw on a whiteboard the answers to many technical questions - we want to hear how you think.</li>
        <li>We will most likely make you tea coffee etc. or possibly have a game of darts during the interview.</li>
        <li>There are a few of us in the office at any time - it's how we work, do not be concerned about the people moving around you.</li>
      </ul>
