      Welcome to the SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network, a new Secure
      way to access a world of existing apps where the security of your data
      is put above all else. Downloading the free SAFE software will provide
      access to: messaging, apps, email, social networks, data storage, video
      conferencing, and many more.

    <h3 class="title">Crowd sourced internet</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Rather than using data centres and servers common within today’s
      Internet, which are prone to data theft and surveillance, the SAFE
      Network uses advanced P2P technology, that joins together the spare
      computing capacity of all SAFE users, creating a global network. You
      can think of SAFE as a crowd sourced Internet. It is on this network
      that everyone’s data and applications reside.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      All you need to join this network is to download the free SAFE software,
      create your account and tell the network how much space you are going to
      provide. It’s that simple!

      <p class="p">
        By providing your unused computing resources to SAFE you will be paid
        in a network token, called <a href="./safecoin.html">safecoin</a>.
        To start earning, download the free SAFE software, create your account
        and tell the network how much space you are going to provide.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        Overtime, your computer (or vault) will start to fill up with network
        data and as a consequence, your virtual wallet will automatically
        start receive safecoin. You can use these to pay for other services on
        the network, or convert to another currency via an SAFE currency
        exchange.
