      Welcome to the SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network, a new Secure
      way to access a world of existing apps where the security of your data
      is put above all else. Downloading the free SAFE software will provide
      access to: messaging, apps, email, social networks, data storage, video
      conferencing, and much more.

    <h3 class="title">Crowd-sourced Internet</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Rather than using data centres and servers which are prone to data theft and surveillance, as is common on today’s
      Internet, the SAFE Network uses advanced peer-to-peer technology that joins together the spare computing capacity
      of all SAFE users, creating a global network. You can think of SAFE as a crowd-sourced Internet. It is on this
      network that everyone’s data and applications reside.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      All you need to do to join this network is to download the free SAFE software, create your account and tell the
      network how much storage space you are going to provide. It’s that simple!

      <p class="p">
        By providing your unused computing resources to SAFE, you will be paid in a network token called
        <a href="./safecoin.html">safecoin</a>. To start earning, download the free SAFE software, create your account and tell the
        network how much storage space you are going to provide.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        Over time, the SAFE vault on your computer will start to fill up with network data, and as a consequence your
        virtual wallet will automatically start receiving safecoin. You can use the <a href="./safecoin.html">safecoin</a>
        you've earned to pay for other services on the network, or convert them to another currency via a SAFE currency exchange.
