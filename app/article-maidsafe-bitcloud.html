    <p>One of the great things about the architecture of the internet is that it is truly decentralized. By design, no one rules it and everyone can use it. But in the last two decades, a small collection of global technology companies have come to control the bulk of internet traffic. Google, Facebook, and others have captured our attention and with it, our data.
