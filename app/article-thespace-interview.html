    <p><strong>The Space</strong><br>04 December 2014</p>
    <p>Ben Murray talks to Nick Lambert from MaidSafe, a new decentralised network that looks to shift away from the server-dominated model of the internet and empower digital creativity into the bargain.</p>
    <p>If you had the opportunity to rebuild the internet from the ground up, what would it look like? Would it resemble what we have now?</p>
    <p>These are the hypotheticals that underpin Jaron Lanier’s 2013 book, Who Owns The Future? A renowned computer scientist and philosopher, Lanier is one of the pre-eminent commentators on modern tech culture, who posits a link between the opaque nature of digital technology and people’s tendency to “succumb to an illusion that there is only one way to design it.”</p>
    <p>The problem, as he identifies it, is that what has evolved is a million miles away from the ideals upon which the internet was founded.</p>
    <p>Instead, what we have has become increasingly centralised, dominated by a small number of huge corporations with the clout and capital to out-compute everyone else. They are happy to trade on users’ personal data for profit and facilitate a scale of surveillance unprecedented in human history. In short, the internet has become too server-centric.</p>
    <p>It’s an analysis with which Nick Lambert (pictured above right), Chief Operating Officer of the Scottish tech company MaidSafe, agrees. “The problem with the current architecture is servers,” he says. “It’s not that we necessarily need to even think of better ways to implement them. Let’s just remove them altogether.”</p>
