    <p><strong>Imperica</strong><br>11 February 2014</p>
    <p>As the Internet continues its exponential growth, it is starting to show the creak of middle age. Its design, using a traditional open client-server relationship, is now unnoticed by us – it's how you accessed this article, for example. However,
      it becomes apparent when the design is infiltrated by Ddos attacks, Government surveillance, or the privatisation of once-public space. As these challenges become answered by decentralized networks, <strong>David Irvine</strong> of Scotland's <strong>Maidsafe</strong> is
      leading the development of what might become a true alternative to the Internet.</p>
    <p>Irvine started out as a network designer and engineer. His company, Eboxit, provided &ldquo;server-in-a-box&rdquo; products and grew rapidly until it became the subject of a bitter shareholder
      dispute. The timing was commercially painful, given that a similar company, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_Networks">Cobalt</a>, was acquired by Sun for $2bn. Eboxit fizzled out and left Irvine with some time to reflect on the
      business, and whether selling client-server products in general was the best and most fair way to offer access to networks. The result was a consideration that the inherent problem in many network infrastructures is not one type of server over another; it's the fact that servers exist at all. Natural paradigms such as ant colonies and cell division prove that life can work without such a methodology. A controlling authority doesn't inherently create weakness. Ergo, client-server
      is quite an &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; way to design a network – it's inefficient. The methodology exists because of its commercial legacy; thin client-based LANs, where the server was the only computer with a hard drive, still exist but the
      majority of network installations are based on lots of PCs and phones, all packed to the rafters with memory, processing power and hard disk space... much of which remains unused and irrelevant to the network.          </p>
