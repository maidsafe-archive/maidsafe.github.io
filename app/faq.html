        <h3>When will I be able to start using the SAFE Network?</h3>
        <p>
          The SAFE Network is under active development and new features will be
          added and rolled out over the coming weeks and months. It is
          anticipated that users will be able to login to the network, provide
          some resources to it and receive test safecoin in return imminently.
          Shortly after, the first of the SAFE applications will be released
          and will include storage and messaging functionality.

        <h3>Why should I use the SAFE Network?</h3>
        <p>
          Applications and programs on the existing Internet sell your privacy
          through advertising and effectively control your data, granting you
          access when you login. On the SAFE Network, only you control who has
          access to your data and the distributed security features make your
          data safer than ever before. If you contribute some of your spare
          computing resource to the network you are also compensated for doing
          so with the in built token, <a href="./safecoin.html">safecoin</a>.

        <h3>What is the App Launcher?</h3>
        <p>
          The App Launcher is an application that enables users to create
          their SAFE account and log into other applications on the SAFE
          Network without passing your login credentials (pin, username and
          password) to anyone else. It can be thought of as the single point
          of contact with the network and keeps you in control of your data at
          all times.

        <h3>Do I store other people's data on my machine?</h3>
        <p>
          SAFE is a network made up of the spare computing resources of its
          users. It can be thought of as a crowd-sourced Internet. When you
          contribute to the network, you allow it to store encrypted pieces
          (not complete files) of other people's files onto your computer. As
          you turn your computer off all network data is removed from your
          machine and will start to fill up again when you turn it back on.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Is there such a thing as SAFE websites?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, and it will be possible to view many of them without creating a
          free SAFE account! All that you require to view SAFE websites is to
          have downloaded the browser extension that MaidSafe has built using
          Mozilla's Firefox browser. You will notice that the web addresses
          will look a little different from what you are used to 'safe:'
          instead of 'http://'.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>How owns the SAFE Network?</h3>
        <p>
          No one. The network is open source and MaidSafe set out to create a
          resource that can be used by everyone to spread all human knowledge
          and to facilitate sharing between everyone on the planet, regardless
          of your country of residence, culture, or economic background.

        <h3>How much will it cost to store data?</h3>
        <p>
          The amount of safecoin it will cost to store data will depend upon
          how much resource is available to the network and how much demand
          there is to store data. Unfortunately, the cost cannot be predicted
          prior to SAFE's launch and will change in line with supply and
          demand after launch.
          <br><br>
          As SAFE does not have many of the overheads and costs of existing
          services, like Dropbox, it is anticipated that storage will be
          significantly cheaper than using any current solutions. It is
          important to note that when storage is bought, it will last forever
          and is not just provided on an annual basis.
