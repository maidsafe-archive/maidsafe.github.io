    <h3>Features of the SAFE Network</h3>
    <p>
        The SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network is made up of the unused hard drive space, processing power and
        data connection of its users. It oﬀers a level of security and privacy not currently available on the
        existing Internet and turns the tables on companies, putting users in control of their data, rather than
        trusting it to organisations. A number of features make this possible:

<!-- Feature 1 -->
<div class="post-2 flip">
    <div class="post-2-media">

    </div>
    <div class="post-2-content">
        <h3 id="self-auth">Login and secure your data with no middle man.</h3>
        <p>
            No need to give your password to anyone, or ask a third party’s permission to access your data.
            Your information, and access to it, belongs to you!
        </p>
        <p>
            Your PIN and Keyword are used to locate your data on the network and your password, which never leaves
            your machine,  is then used to decrypt it locally. This means that no one needs to hold a record of your
            ﬁles, or your login details and there’s no need to ask anyone for permission to access it. This process
            is called Self-Authentication and enables you to ﬁnd, unlock and decrypt your own data.
        </p>
    </div>

<!-- Feature 2 -->
<div class="post-2">
    <div class="post-2-media">
        <img src="./img/features_2.svg" alt="Self-Encryption" />
    </div>
    <div class="post-2-content">
        <h3 id="self-encryption">Self-Encryption: Data which encrypts itself, with itself.</h3>
        <p>
            Files uploaded to the network are broken into pieces, encrypted and distributed across the network.
            This process is called Self-Encryption.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a user uploads (or saves) a ﬁle to the network, via one of the SAFE Network apps, the ﬁle is
            automatically broken up into chunks. These chunks are then encrypted (encoded so that only authorised
            parties can read it),  randomised and stored on the computers of other SAFE Network users. These encrypted
            chunks are completely unreadable and inaccessible to anyone other than the owner.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="post-2-content">
        <h3 id="distributed-network">Distributed network with opportunistic data caching.</h3>
        <p>
            The SAFE Network is fully decentralised, with ﬁles distributed and stored all over the world, on diﬀerent
            devices. This allows the network to be robust to attacks, with no central point of weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The distributed nature of the network provides your data with physical security, meaning that no
            third party can access or delete it, as can happen with existing centralised solutions.
            The feature called Opportunistic Caching automatically creates more copies of popular data closer to where
            it is being requested, so popular websites and other data feeds will actually speed up as they get more
            visitors, rather than slow down and crash as they do on today’s web.
        </p>

<!-- Feature 4 -->
<div class="post-2">
    <div class="post-2-media">
        <img src="./img/features_4.svg" alt="Data Availability" />
    </div>
    <div class="post-2-content">
        <h3 id="data-availability">Data availability and built-in redundancy.</h3>
        <p>
            The network is programmed to keep duplicate copies of each piece of data at all times. As users turn their
            computers off, the network makes more copies and stores them on other machines, ensuring that users always
            have access to their files.
        </p>
        <p>
            This constant movement of data (called churn) is a key part of the security that the SAFE Network offers
            because there is no central point for hackers to target as the data locations keep changing.
        </p>

<!-- Feature 5 -->
<div class="post-2 flip">
    <div class="post-2-media">
        <img src="./img/features_5.svg" alt="Data De-duplication" />
    </div>
    <div class="post-2-content">
        <h3 id="de-duplication">Unneeded duplicates are automatically removed.</h3>
        <p>
            Once a ﬁle is uploaded, other users who upload the same ﬁle will be automatically referred to the original,
            limiting the number of copies and reducing the computing resources needed to store it.
