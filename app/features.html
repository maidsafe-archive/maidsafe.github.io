    <h3>Features of the SAFE Network</h3>
    <p>
        The SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network is made up of the unused hard drive space, processing power and
        data connection of it's users. It oﬀers a level of security and privacy not currently available on the
        existing Internet and turns the tables on companies, putting users in control of their data, rather than
        trusting it to organisations. A number of features make this possible:

        <h3>Login and secure your data with no middle man.</h3>
        <p>
            No need to give your password to anyone, or ask a third party’s permission to access your data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your Pin and Keyword are used to locate your data on the network and your password, which never leaves
            your machine,  is then used to decrypt it locally. This means that no one needs to hold a record your
            ﬁles, or your login details and there’s no need to ask anyone for permission to access it. This process
            is called Self-Authentication and enables you to ﬁnd, unlock and decrypt your own data.

        <h3>Self-Encryption: Data which encrypts itself, with itself.</h3>
        <p>
            Files uploaded to the network are broken into pieces, encrypted and distributed across the network.
            This process is called Self-Encryption.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a user uploads (or saves) a ﬁle to the network, via one of the SAFE Network apps, the ﬁle is
            automatically broken up into chunks. These chunks are then encrypted (encoded so that only authorised
            parties can read it),  randomised and stored on the computers of other SAFE Network users. These encrypted
            chunks are completely unreadable and inaccessible to anyone other than the owner.

        <h3>Distributed Network with opportunistic data caching.</h3>
        <p>
            The SAFE Network is fully decentralised with ﬁles distributed and stored all over the world, in diﬀerent
            locations and devices. This allows the network to be robust to attacks, with no central point of weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The distributed nature of the networks gives your data physical security and means no third party can
            access or delete your data as can happen with existing centralised solutions. Being fully decentralised
            and using features such as Opportunistic Caching automatically creates more copies of popular data closer
            to where it is being requested. This means that things like websites will actually speed up as they get
            more visitors, rather than slow down and crash as they do in today’s web.

    <div class="post-2-content">
        <h3>Data availability and built-in redundancy.</h3>
        <p>
            The network is programmed to keep duplicate copies of each piece of data at all times, and as users turn
            their computers oﬀ, the network moves the data to machines that are turned on, to ensure users always
            have access to their ﬁles.
        </p>
        <p>
            This constant movement of data (called ‘churn’) is a key part of the security that the SAFE Network oﬀers
            as there is no central point for hackers to target as the data locations keep changing.

        <h3>Unneeded duplicates are automatically removed.</h3>
        <p>
            The SAFE Network has a high degree of deduplication built in from the beginning. The total number of
            duplicate copies can be much lower on our network than existing alternatives. Intelligent caching and the
            decentralised nature of the network allow ﬁles to be placed right where they’re needed, reducing latency
            and unneeded duplicates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a ﬁle is uploaded, other users who upload the same ﬁle will be referred to the original, limiting
            the number of copies and reducing the computing resources needed to store it.
