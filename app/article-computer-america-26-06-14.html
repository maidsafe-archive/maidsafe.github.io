    <p>Hour one: Craig and Charles do Computer and Technology News, brought to you by Slimware Utilities, the Official Optimization Software of Computer America, and answer your computer questions!</p>

    <p>Hour two: MaidSafe believes the ability to simply open a file or look at an image without divulging any information about yourself is key to the growth in data sharing and knowledge transfer. Yet we pay for many 'free systems' on the internet with the very privacy that we have guarded for years. MaidSafe software represents a shift in this paradigm, enabling users to access information freely, without being tracked. Their technology ensures there is no access wall to data such as web servers or traditional data access mechanisms that exist today.</p>
