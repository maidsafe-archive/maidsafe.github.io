    <p><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong><br>8 April 2014</p>
    <h3>From the Inside Bitcoins Conference:</h3>
    <p>- <strong>Rep. Steve Stockman (R, Texas) was at the Inside Bitcoins conference</strong> in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, sharing a bill he plans to introduce  in Congress asking the IRS to reconsider its decision earlier this month  declaring <a href="http://www.wsj.com/video/what-a-bitcoin/D79FF38C-7816-435B-B3B0-F9B177BCA0A8.html" data-ls-seen="1">bitcoin</a> property for tax purposes.</p>
    <p>The bill currently is a draft, a mere one page, directing the IRS to  treat bitcoin as currency for tax purposes. Of course, the goal of the bill isn&rsquo;t necessarily to get Congress to codify bitcoin into law. Rep.  Stockman, an aficionado who accepted bitcoin donations for his  reelection campaign, is looking to get a conversation going on the  topic.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s not accurate,&rdquo; he said of the IRS ruling. To him,  bitcoin is not a commodity, but a currency. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not sugar, it&rsquo;s not  gold.&rdquo; Rep. Stockman concedes to one major problem: There is still much  debate, even at the conference, about what bitcoin actually is. He suggested we go into the conference and ask 10 different people, much  like he did. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get 10 different answers.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Regardless, he plans to introduce his bill later this month.  Understanding how slowly Congress moves, and knowing how few of his  fellow lawmakers are up on developments in digital currency (if not  outright hostile), he isn&rsquo;t necessarily looking for action there. What  he really wants is just to stir up debate on the question, in the hope  that the IRS changes its stance.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The IRS can act quicker than Congress,&rdquo; he said. <em>(Paul Vigna)</em></p>
