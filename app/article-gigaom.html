    <p><strong>Gigaom</strong><br>23 May 2014</p>
    <p>The internet today is broken (which is why Gigaom recently devoted a series of articles to the subject of fixing it). Control of key elements is becoming  more centralized; it is being increasingly censored and manipulated;  many aspects are open to intrusion; and the cloud&rsquo;s need for expensively  massive server operations breeds business models that rely on turning  everyone&rsquo;s private data points into dollars.</p>
    <p>A bunch of slightly mad Scots at a company called MaidSafe may have  the solution. Over an impressively lengthy development period of 8  years, they have come up with something called the Secure Access For  Everyone (Safe) network, which they are about to start testing. If it  pans out, the Safe network will provide an un-censorable, secure,  resilient successor to today&rsquo;s internet, complete with a built-in  economy and the foundations for a distributed, autonomous intelligence.</p>
    <p>The idea is not wholly original – a dash of distributed computing here, a soupçon of altcoin there – but it is impressively glued together and actually relatively  plausible as these things go. That&rsquo;s not to say Safe doesn&rsquo;t have  problems, because it does, but they may not be insurmountable.</p>
