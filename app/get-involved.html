    <p>There are many ways to get involved with the SAFE network.</p>

      <a href="core-developers"><img src="/img/tab-core-dev-icon.png" alt="Core Developers" /></a>
      <p>If you are a Rust developer and are interested in helping the community to maintain and progress the underlying network code please visit our <a href="core-developers">core developers</a> page to find out more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="app-builders-text">
      <a href="app-builders"><img src="/img/tab-app-builder-icon.png" alt="App Builders" /></a>
      <p>If you are an application developer and are looking to create great applications on the SAFE network then visit our <a href="app-builders">app builder</a> page. Here you will be able to find out more about how the SAFE libraries connect, our in-built revenue model and how to get started.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="farmers-text">
      <a href="farmers"><img src="/img/tab-farmer-icon.png" alt="Farmers" title="Farmers" /></a>
      <p>If you would like to contribute some of your spare computing resource to the network then please visit our <a href="farmers">farmers</a> page. Farming, analogous to miners in the Bitcoin world, enables all users to earn safecoin (the network’s crypto currency) in return for supplying storage space, CPU and bandwidth to the SAFE network.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Issues surrounding farming, building and core development are actively discussed in our community run <a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/" target="_blank">forum</a>. It is a very welcoming and encouraging environment, feel free to dive in and get involved!</p>
