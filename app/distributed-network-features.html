    <h1>Distributed Network Features</h1>
    <p>The MaidSafe vision is to replace today's existing server centric and intrusive systems with a fully distributed, safe, secure and private network. A network with no third party being able to intercept, copy, steal, sell or otherwise access the networkâ€™s data.</p>
    <p>The SAFE platform provides a distributed network that allows developers to create fast and secure applications of any kind. With no API key to be purchased and no infrastructure required, developers are not exposed to any financial risk with significantly reduced customer acquisition costs. </p>
