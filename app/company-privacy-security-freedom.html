      <h2>PRIVACY</h2>
      <p>We believe the ability to simply open a file or look at an image without divulging any information about yourself is key to the growth in data sharing and knowledge transfer. Yet we pay for many 'free systems' on the internet with the very privacy that we have guarded for years. An Internet that maintains anonymising capabilities as part of the core will push power back to individuals while propelling innovation and truth.</p>

    <div class="grid-3 col-3 middle-col">
      <h2>SECURITY</h2>
      <p>In the digital world most of us do not realise what data should be secure and where potential problems may arise. We are generally satisfied to see a word like security or encryption on a web page and believe that the information is safe but do not take into account the trust we are placing in individual businesses to protect servers and our data. We believe in a serverless Internet with built-in network security.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid-3 col-3 right-col">
      <h2>FREEDOM</h2>
      <p>The freedom to think, freedom to roam and the freedom to communicate thoughts and desires are for many, a dream and for many others, an illusion. Increased creativity and innovation through free will and freedom to learn drive forward the human races' understanding of the universe around us, improving not only our technological but emotional development. We believe an Internet with inherent privacy through security is an essential tool for human flourishing.</p>
