    <p><strong>Libertarian Home</strong><br>29 March 2014</p>
    <p>Astonished. That was the overwhelming thought I was left with after listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sovryntech/sovryn-tech-special-0021" target="_blank">a 73 minute podcast</a> between the brash, sexually liberated, libertarian American, &lsquo;King of  the Nerds&rsquo;, Brian Sovryn and a mild mannered, boat loving, free thinking  futurist and software engineer from Scotland named <a href="http://metaquestions.me/" target="_blank">David Irvine</a>.</p>
    <p>The latter has spent the last 8 years designing and codingÂ nothing less than a solution for a decentralised internet named Maidsafe.  Users of the open source system share resources from their computer,  such as hard drive space and processing power, and in return for this  &lsquo;work&rsquo; can use the combined resources of the network for data storage,  website hosting and computing power. The system backs up data into  encrypted &lsquo;shards&rsquo; that are duplicated and stored on multiple computers  in the system, such that only those with the keys to decrypt the data  will be able to reassemble and interpret these shards. The network  adjusts dynamically so that if resources are being used more frequently  they become more accessible to all participants. Data can be shared and  websites or web assets can be hosted on the system, without the need to  store any data in corporate data centres or servers.</p>
