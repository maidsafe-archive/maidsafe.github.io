            scalable, secure data storage and access solution which avoids network
            bottlenecks and central points of failure. It will fundamentally change
            the way we think about storing data.</span>

        <blockquote class="quote"><span>This network is a huge step forward in handling private data that will definitely change our attitude to privacy in the Internet - that is the stored data is not controlled or analysed or associated with their owner but is simply kept as 0s and 1s. Isn't that great!</span>
