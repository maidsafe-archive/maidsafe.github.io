          <h2>Treats the MaidSafe network as a filesystem.<br>
  Exposes a pseudo RESTful interface (GET PUT POST DELETE)</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p id="u1863-12">This library provides a RESTful-like API for clients to connect to the SAFE network. Client interactivity with the network will create the appropriate policies to be passed to the policy-based class design environment. This library can be
            considered a helper library to connect clients to distributed networks such as the SAFE platform.</p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Separation of responsibilities between client applications and network requests.</li>
            <li>Serialisation and parsing of network messages.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Programming languages</h3>
          <h3>Core</h3>
          <p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64 bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion and above).</p>
          <h3>Status</h3>
          <p>This library is considered <strong>PRE-ALPHA</strong> quality and is provided with a full test suite and QA suite. Developers should be aware of this <strong>PRE-ALPHA</strong> state if considering using this library for production quality systems
            at this time. This library will be Alpha quality imminently (undergoing rapid development).</p>
          <h3>Roadmap</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Imminent release to Beta</li>
            <li>Improve API to allow client created policies to be passed to the RESTful interface</li>
            <li>Improve efficiency of message types</li>
            <li>Implement further type safety</li>
            <li>Investigate option of passing new structured data types via the network.</li>
            <li>Implement manual merge capabilities for structured data</li>
          </ul>
