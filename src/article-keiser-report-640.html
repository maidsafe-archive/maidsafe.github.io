          <p>Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert discuss the Portrait of Uncle Sam aging horribly in the basement of Fort Knox and on the real economic data charts while flouncing around the world as if a spritely and handsome young thing. In the second half, Max interviews Nick Lambert and David Irvine of MaidSafe about reinventing the internet with proof of resource and decentralization. </p>
