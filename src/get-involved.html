          <p>If you would like to contribute some of your spare computing resource to the network then please visit our <a href="farmers">farmers</a> page. Farming, analogous to miners in the Bitcoin world, enables all users to earn safecoin (the network’s crypto currency) in return for supplying storage space, CPU and bandwidth to the SAFE network.</p>
