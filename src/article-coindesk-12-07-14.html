  <p>Eight years ago, David Irvine launched a company with modest ambitions: to decentralize the Internet.</p>
  <p>MaidSafe aims to offer an alternative to the widespread use of servers: a decentralized data network on which decentralized applications can be built.</p>
  <p>The Scotland-based platform held a successful crowdsale to raise funding earlier this year, netting $6m in under six hours. Five hundred developers, MaidSafe says, have since joined its ranks.</p>
  <p>Decentralization is a persistent theme that has surfaced again and again in the cryptocurrency community, but Irvine has his own unique take on the phenomenon. He often describes how ants, neurons and other natural marvels guide the structure of the decentralized data platform.</p>
