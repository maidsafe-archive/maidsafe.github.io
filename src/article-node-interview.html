          <p>Maidsafe is one of those rare projects which aims to fundamentally redefine how we interact with each other, and their goal to create a new decentralized Internet is almost unrivaled in ambition and potential impact. If done correctly, it could herald a new era of truly private connected living, where each user has total control over their own data.</p>
          <p>It’s personally been something that I’ve kept my eye on for some time now and I was lucky enough to speak to Nick Lambert, one of the team members working on the project. He was kind enough to answer my questions about Maidsafe’s goals, their reasoning behind various decisions and much more.</p>
          <p>[N-] You started Maidsafe in 2006, way before Bitcoin and the Snowden revelations influenced most peoples thinking on the subjects of internet privacy and digital money. What were the original aims and goals for the project?</p>
          <p>[NL] David Irvine (the inventor and CEO) has been working in and around small business severs for a number of years and recognised how difficult they were to configure and how expensive they were. Over a period of a number of years, he recognised that rather than try to improve these servers, the answer was to remove them. David identified that the existing client - server model was inefficient and, taking inspiration from nature, observed the lack of intermediaries that existed through millions of years of evolution. David focussed specifically on harvester ant colonies (even visiting Debra Gordon @ Stanford) realising that a peer to peer architecture was far more efficient. David also realised that not only were servers inefficient, expensive and hard to use, they were also centralised points of weakness and were robbing users of the security and privacy that they deserved. At that point he set out to start to decentralise everything and MaidSafe was incorporated in Feb 2006. The goals or the organisation at that time were Privacy Security Freedom.</p>
