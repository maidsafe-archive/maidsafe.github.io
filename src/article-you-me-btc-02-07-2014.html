            <p><strong>You Me and BTC</strong><br>30 June 2014</p>
  <p>This is another special interview from the Bitcoin in the Beltway conference. This time, we are speaking with Paige Peterson, a representative from MaidSafe. While the project has been around for much longer than Bitcoin, it has only recently become very popular among the cryptocurrency community. Paige will explain what the network really is and how it is different than Bitcoin. We will also chat about the conference in general for a bit.</p>
