          <h2>Vault Component of the MaidSafe Network</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p id="u1863-12">This library provides a RESTful-like API for clients to connect to the SAFE network. Client interactivity with the network will create the appropriate policies to be passed to the policy-based class design environment. This library can be
            considered a helper library to connect clients to distributed networks such as the SAFE platform.</p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Distributed structured data</li>
            <li>Distributed unstructured data</li>
            <li>Automatic fail-over and self healing</li>
            <li>Consistent data integrity checking and repairing</li>
            <li>Node Identification guaranteed via PKI provided by <a href="libraries-passport">MaidSafe-Passport</a>
            </li>
            <li>Fully encrypted data store (key value)</li>
            <li>Public data store</li>
            <li>Shared data handling</li>
            <li>Data versioning and merge resolution (mostly automatic)</li>
            <li>Built to run in hostile environments (including public Internet)</li>
            <li>No servers required at all (no DNS, time servers etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Programming languages</h3>
          <h3>Core</h3>
          <p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64 bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion and above).</p>
          <h3>Status</h3>
          <p>This library is considered <span id="u1915-54"><strong>PRE&#45;ALPHA</strong></span>&nbsp;quality and is provided with a full test suite and QA suite. This should not be considered for use in production quality systems at this time. There is
            currently a limit on message size that requires attention at the earliest convenience.</p>
          <h3>Roadmap</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Improve ranking system to recognise further improper behaviour</li>
            <li>Improve type safety of network messages</li>
            <li>Measure fully distributed local data stores for account handling</li>
            <li>Provide further API enhancements to allow client merge policies and structured data object handling</li>
          </ul>
