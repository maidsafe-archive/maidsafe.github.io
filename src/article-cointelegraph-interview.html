          <p><strong>Cointelegraph</strong><br>15 April 2014</p>  
          <p>The Coin Telegraph had a chance to sit down with David Irvine, CEO, Maidsafe.net limited. 
          </p>
            <p>Coin Telegraph: How did you get involved with cryptography? </p>
            <p>David Irvine: As  an Engineer, I have always liked puzzles. Cryptography is the ultimate  puzzle for me. MaidSafe required significant cryptographic algorithms  and protections; this forced much more detailed analysis and thinking.  In 2006-7 in particular, I had to throw myself into more detail and  understand more about the various ciphers and their uses. </p>
            <p>CT: What inspired you to start MaidSafe? Could you shed some light on this project? </p>
            <p>DI:   I thought the Internet had become a very unnatural design and could  not bear to see people lose control of their identities and personal  thoughts. I figured that with all the computing resource available in  people&rsquo;s personal computers that we could do a much better job with what  we have. MaidSafe seemed like an obvious answer, rather than creating  large server farms, use peoples own computers. Create a large network  that all computers join and allow people to access this network and  store their information there as well as communicate etc. The problems  that required solving were pretty huge, as this type of design had never  been attempted. There were some p2p networks and so forth but nothing  that could create a large network driven by the people for the people.  This had to be something controlled by math and not humans. Another  great puzzle for us to work on and solve. </p>
