          <h2>MaidSafe Encrypt Library</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> an encryption algorithm per se, rather this is an algorithm that utilises existing very well tested algorithms (predominantly AES 256 in this case). The library provides a sliding window algorithm that can encrypt
            data of any length, even if written in a random manner (or parts overwritten during write). It is very useful for encrypting disk based storage of huge data or writing data encrypted to a key value store in a manner that cannot be algorithmically
            reversed (as in reversing AES or similar algorithms). The chunks of data provided are self checking and the process is recursive, so the keys output can themselves be concatenated into a large file and passed back into the algorithm, creating
            a single key for any size of data set.</p>
          <h3>Overview of use in the SAFE Platform</h3>
          <p>Data encryption in the prototype implementation uses a combination of cryptographically secure hashing and AES256 symmetric encryption. Files are chunked, hashed, and then the hash of each chunk is combined with the hashes of the preceding two
            chunks (cyclically) to produce keying material to encrypt that chunk. This chaining obfuscates common file fragments. The resulting encrypted chunk is the data stored in the network, and its hash stored in the data map. The system uses an
            underlying peer to peer network based on a Kademlia DHT. This is a very efficient hash table implementation that has been widely deployed in many networks of millions of nodes. Unlike standard peer to peer networks, data can be deleted from
            the network under instruction from authorised clients with the appropriate digital signature and validated ID.</p>

          <h3>Encrypt overview</h3>
          <p>Encryption is based on the file content and so known plaintext attacks are possible. However, this is a requirement of deduplication, and is only possible when the adversary already has a copy of the file. It is possible to
            recognise chunks belonging to particular files, and therefore the presence of particular known files on the system, but it is not possible to tie those chunks to a particular user.</p>
          <p id="u1832-30">Files are always split into a minimum of three chunks (smaller files are encoded within the data map directly for efficiency), so the probability of simultaneous collisions on all file chunk hashes are small enough to be ignored.</p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Extremely secure data encryption</li>
            <li>Very high speed, due to parallel algorithms making use of multi cores [previous version measured read and write at over 1Gb/s with ease in an SSD raid 5 system that achieves only ~300Mbs with raw data]</li>
            <li>Can handle out of sequence reads and concurrent out of sequence writes</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Programming languages</h3>
          <h3>Core</h3>
          <p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64 bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion and above).</p>
          <h3>Status</h3>
          <p>This library is considered <strong>BETA</strong> quality and is provided with a full test suite and QA suite. This can be considered for use in production quality systems at this time.</p>
          <h3>Roadmap</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Upgrade to Generic programming</li>
            <li>Implement exceptions and exception safety</li>
            <li>Rewrite to C++11 standards (use std::array and vector specifically to improve safety) especially move aware containers.</li>
          </ul>
