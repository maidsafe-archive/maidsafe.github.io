          <h2>MaidSafe Passport Library</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p id="u1863-12">Creates cryptographically secure Public Key Infrastructure mechanism via a mixture of asymmetric encryption currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29" target="_blank">RSA</a> and secure hashing currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2"
            target="_blank">SHA512</a>.</p>
          <p id="u1863-22">With this library and a secure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table" target="_blank">DHT</a> such as <a href="libraries-routing">MaidSafe-Routing</a> there is no requirement for a certificate
            authority. Removing another server system and the related human administration, allows developers to create autonomous distributed secure systems.</p>
          <p id="u1863-24">MaidSafe uses this feature to ensure nodes (and humans) can be securely validated and regulated in a mathematical manner that is as fair as the rules developers create and not via any human administrator.</p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fully encapsulated and tested security system</li>
            <li>Identify network assets with clarity and confidence</li>
            <li>Remove certificate authorities and associated security weaknesses (and payments)</li>
            <li>Includes key revocation capability when in conjunction with <a href="libraries-routing">MaidSafe-Routing</a> and <a href="libraries-vault">MaidSafe-Vault</a> via <a href="libraries-network-file-system">MaidSafe-Network-Filesystem</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Programming languages</h3>
          <h3>Core</h3>
          <p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64 bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion and above).</p>
          <h3>Status</h3>
          <p>This library is considered <strong>BETA</strong> quality and is provided with a full test suite and QA suite. This can be considered for use in production quality systems at this time.</p>
          <h3>Roadmap</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Constantly investigate asymmetric algorithms for improvements</li>
            <li>Improve revocation capability (i.e. include API for key crippling)</li>
          </ul>
