          <p>The SAFE network is a sizeable piece of code with documentation to match. This page attempts to consolidate all our support materials in one place to make our content easier to navigate.</p>

          <h2>System Docs</h2>
          <p>This section provides a comprehensive introduction to MaidSafe and the SAFE project. This is an excellent starting point for those looking to 'dip their toe in the water’ and find out more about how the system works, getting involved with the network and the main platform components. While there are some technical sections, the bulk of the text is designed to be high level and accessible. </p>

           <h2>Papers &amp; Publications</h2> 
          <p>MaidSafe has strived to validate our technology by working with Universities, publishing papers (some of which are attached below) and <a href="http://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=maidsafe&amp;tbm=pts" target="_blank">filing patent applications</a>. These documents and links are aimed at the more technical reader and aim to provide a relatively detailed view of the technology employed in the SAFE network.</p>
