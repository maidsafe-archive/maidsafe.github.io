            <p><strong>CoinDesk</strong><br>23 May 2014</p>
  <p>The  MaidSafe project announced today it has 500 developers signed up to  build applications for its decentralized Internet platform. This follows  the project&rsquo;s successful crowd sale that raised $6m in its first five  hours.</p>
  <p>MaidSafe has the ambitious aim of radically decentralizing all the web services  that exist today, and is working on projects that include altcoin  wallets, unlimited file storage and sharing applications, a  decentralized music store, secure messaging applications and a  decentralized altcoin and fiat currency exchange.</p>
  <p>The idea is that  these services will be free, not only from authoritarian shutdowns and  seizures, but also hackers and other malicious attacks. On MaidSafe&rsquo;s  planned network, all data is &ldquo;shredded, encrypted and distributed to  participating computers, or &lsquo;nodes&rsquo;, throughout the world&rdquo;.</p>
