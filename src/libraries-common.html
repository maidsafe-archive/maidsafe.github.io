          <h2>Library of utility functions</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Utilities used by most of the SAFE libraries.</p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Cryptographic helpers for asymmetric, symmetric algorithms and key sizes</li>
            <li>Secure hashing helpers</li>
            <li>N+P key sharing scheme (Shamir)</li>
            <li>Exception safety helpers (see on_scope_exit.h)</li>
            <li>Active object helper</li>
            <li>ASIO helper (deadline timers and async service handling)</li>
            <li>LOG facility (lightweight Debug logging)</li>
            <li>Google Test runner helper (test.h)</li>
            <li>String manipulators (bounded stings, tagged values) to allow creation of concrete types (we limit use of bare strings in favour of type safety)</li>
            <li>Safe queue (internally synchronised queue)</li>
            <li>Error handling system (MaidSafe and Client errors) with categories and codes per library</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Programming languages</h3>
          <h3>Core</h3>
          <p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and  MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64  bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion  and above).</p>
          <h3>Status</h3>
          <p>This library is considered BETA quality and is provided with a test  suite and QA suite. This can be considered for use in production quality  systems at this time.</p>
          <h3>Roadmap</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Async improvements (task stealing systems)</li>
            <li>Introduce Co-Routines</li>
            <li>Investigate internal serialisation and parsing mechanisms</li>
          </ul>
