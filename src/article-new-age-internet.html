          <p>The MaidSafe ( &ldquo;Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone&rdquo; ) vision is to replace today&rsquo;s existing server centric and intrusive systems with a fully distributed, safe, secure and private network.  The MaidSafe network is completely anonymous, secure and aims to repel human intervention of any kind; it cannot be controlled or &lsquo;owned&rsquo;. MaidSafe&rsquo;s intelligent algorithms developed over the last seven years. This self-regulating network lets users offer spare drive space and in return delivers anonymous, super-fast internet. MaidSafe could potentially re-invent the internet much in the way apps changed software.</p>
<p>The MaidSafe platform provides a distributed network that allows developers to create fast and secure applications of any kind. With no API key to be purchased and no infrastructure required, developers are not exposed to any financial risk with significantly reduced customer acquisition costs.Developers can get their apps and ideas up and running, on a huge scale, without spending a penny. This levels the playing field between big companies and the independent creators who, currently, might not be able to compete due to a lack of funds to rent storage space for their projects.</p>
