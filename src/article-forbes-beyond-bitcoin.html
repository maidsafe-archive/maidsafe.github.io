           <p><strong>Forbes</strong><br>8 April 2014</p>
      <p>David Irvine lives in a tiny beach town called Troon on the West  Coast of Scotland. He describes it as a place where old people go to  retire, with a population of 15,000, a thriving golf community and views  of the cliffs of Ireland on a clear day. It's a surprising place from  which to launch a product that he hopes will transform the way the  Internet works.</p>
<p>Irvine is a mechanical engineer who taught himself about computers  when he "realized they would be big." He went on to manage oil company  Saudi Aramco's computer network before founding his own network  consulting company, Alba, in the UK. After realizing that "the way the  Internet is designed is insane," he unplugged and started sailing,  eventually becoming a yachtmaster who would pick up newly bought boats,  say in the south of France, and sail them home to their owners in the  UK. In 2006, he moved to a place where no English was spoken (so he  could concentrate) to write the white paper for "<a href="http://maidsafe.net/">MaidSafe</a>": a network for crypto-ownership and storage that does for data what <a href="http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/secret-money-living-on-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> does for value. Over the last eight years, he's gotten $5 million in  funding from family and friends to hire 14 people and try to make his  product a reality. This month, the company is doing its first public  funding round. Highly non-traditional, it plans to raise funds by  issuing "Safecoins" on a cryptocurrency protocol called <a href="http://www.mastercoin.org/">Mastercoin</a>, which itself is built on top of Bitcoin.</p>
