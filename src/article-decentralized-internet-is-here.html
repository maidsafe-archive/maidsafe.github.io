          <p>MaidSafe is a technology company developing a completely secure, fully decentralized peer-to-peer network that could change the future of the Internet.</p>
          <p>Eight years in development, MaidSafe's network is nearing the point of public beta testing and can be seen operating <a href="http://blog.maidsafe.net/2014/01/24/vault-network-test/">in-house</a>. A significant portion of the company's code base is available for <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe"
            target="_blank">download</a> under an Open Source license.</p>
          <p>Having started with minimal resources, the now 16-strong Scotland-based MaidSafe team has created a technology platform that is self-organising, distributed, server free, and requires no additional infrastructure beyond what we have today. Founder
            David Irvine created MaidSafe after designing some of the world's largest private data networks in the early 1990s (Saudi Aramco Dhahran BI3270 and National Network BI3330), followed by working for a number of successful companies as a software
            Engineer and serial entrepreneur.</p>
          <p>The concept for the network was born out of frustration with traditional approaches to computer network architecture relying on inefficient client/server models. MaidSafe drew inspiration for its new network design from studying complex natural
            systems, with a particular focus on ant colonies, neural networks and cell division, which share the traits of being open and decentralized.</p>
          <p>Having raised &pound;2.75 Million since the company's formation in 2006, Irvine believes MaidSafe is the only impregnable solution for privacy of personal data, claiming that &quot;no matter how you encrypt your data, every existing method is
            vulnerable&quot;. In what he touts as a &quot;world first&quot;, the MaidSafe network "creates security by logic and mathematics. It operates autonomously and does not rely on intermediaries&quot;.</p>
          <p>How MaidSafe works is that each individual user contributes capacity to what is effectively a global, public cloud. Personal information is uploaded onto the network with a key. Each file is then split into fragments that are scattered throughout
            the network. Individually, these fragments are meaningless without the user's key, by contrast to the situation today, where data are stored in a complete or semi-complete form on random network nodes with associated metadata, making them
            susceptible to interception and decryption. With MaidSafe, information is always stored in a disassembled form.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;To my knowledge, this technology should revolutionise the way data is managed, optimizing security, data validation and storage space requirements beyond any solution currently available in the industry.&quot;

          <p>You might think that there needs to be very significant uptake and redundancy in the MaidSafe system to make it work and account for the possibility of individual users going offline. However, the system has been proven with as few as 60 users
            or nodes, and modelling projects between MaidSafe and <a href="https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/3000302/6460200/IP11-016_Maidsafe_Stirling_CaseStudy/1cd4b97e-7805-48ad-b49f-e0049dc6de14;jsessionid=0E2DC08D526C707C51A1CADF29E8DD01.2"
            target="_blank">Stirling University</a> have proven that fidelity only increases at scale. Each data fragment is replicated in multiple 'live' and 'dead' copies on different parts of the constantly optimised network. If one of the live copies is somehow lost or tampered with, a new copy is produced elsewhere within 20 milliseconds. The system reacts to tampering and human intervention by design, immediately eliminating suspicious nodes or hardware in the network and redirecting traffic elsewhere. This is how the system can prevent seizure by a virus, if someone was clever enough to make one work from a tiny fragment. The network performs constant integrity checks, ensuring data is in place and untarnished, so any introduction of corruption rapidly invalidates offending data at the point of genesis, with the network de-ranking the data-holder and removing them from the network. The only way MaidSafe envisages data loss is if more than four continents went permanently offline, all within 20 milliseconds, and if the cache also failed.</p>
          <p>One of the benefits of a decentralized system is the capacity to adapt in real-time to demand. Anyone who has experienced a site crash or tried to allocate network provisioning knows the guesswork involved in these activities. MaidSafe employs
            opportunistic caching, which multiplies copies of popular data, meaning that the <a href="/libraries-routing">system</a> only gets faster with increasing traffic.</p>
          <p>MaidSafe's technology has been peer-reviewed in IEEE and has been presented at international conferences including the Wireless World Research Forum, British Computer Society, and the Google Scalability Conference.</p>

            <p>&quot;MaidSafe’s technology is a huge step forward in handling private data and will definitely change our attitude toward privacy on the Internet. The fact that data is stored in locations only known to the network, is not analysed and cannot be associated with their owner is great!&quot;
