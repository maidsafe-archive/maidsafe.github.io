<p>By introducing the SAFE networks very own crypto currency, safecoin, developers now finally have an Open Source business model that works. By coding
your safe wallet ID into your application(s), the network will automatically pay safecoins to you based on how much the application is utilised by end
users. No longer will app developers need to morph themselves into support experts or advertising resellers, you can now focus on making great applications
with a revenue stream already built in.</p>

<p>As an Open Source developer access to the SAFE network will be completely free of charge, enabling you to outperform all incumbents, with back end infra 
structure that automatically adapts in real-time to demand fluctuations, which also allows you to offer anonymity, security and privacy to all your users. To help get you up and running, MaidSafe are releasing a number of example applications, these can be accessed <a href="http://maidsafe.net/maidsafe-examples/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


<p>The SAFE network API is being developed and is available <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe-API/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>. Join us and start work on your next venture, we will help make your vision a reality.</p>
<p>MaidSafe are starting developer pods which will decentralise the SAFE network knowledge base and help to establish a world wide community. These pods will bring together like minded individuals who are are working on the core network code, or applications that sit on top of the network. To find out more visit the <a href="http://maidsafe.meetup.com" target="_blank">meetup website</a>.</p>
