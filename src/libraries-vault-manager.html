          <h2>MaidSafe Vault Manager Library</h2>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>This project implements the Vault-Manager. This is an installed  application that is responsible for checking for upgrades (in real time)  to vaults, installing and testing upgrades as well as starting and  restarting any vaults (on failure or planned). The Vault-Manager manages  private keys for vaults and passes keys through a local TCP network.  This is a one-way mechanism and any vault compromised cannot read the  keys of the local disk.          </p>
          <h3>Programming languages</h3>
          <h3>Core</h3>
          <p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and  MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64  bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion  and above).</p>
          <h3>Status</h3>
          <p>This library is considered ALPHA quality and is provided with a test  suite and QA suite. This should not be considered for use in production  quality systems at this time.</p>
          <h3>Roadmap</h3>
          <ul><li>Allow upgrade manager component to start sacrificial vault and monitor  rank, only installing upgrade for all vaults if the rank of the  sacrificial vault stays on par with existing vaults or improves. This  allows the network to add a QA/test mechanism to code upgrades and  refuse those upgrades that do not measurably improve the network.</li>
          </ul>
